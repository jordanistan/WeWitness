# Data Retention

WeWitness aims to keep data only as long as necessary.

## Defaults (Suggested)

- Unshared vault videos: auto-delete after 30 days (user can “Preserve” to keep longer)
- Incident beacons (metadata): auto-delete after 30 days
- Incident video contributions: auto-delete after 30 days unless preserved by the uploader
- Logs (non-sensitive operational logs): 14–30 days

## Preserve / Legal Hold

- Users can preserve specific videos.
- If WeWitness receives a valid legal preservation request, content may be placed on hold where required by law.

## User Deletion

- Users can request deletion of:
  - their account
  - their videos
  - their incident contributions
- Deletion requests remove access and schedule data for removal from storage within a defined window.
