# Law Enforcement & Government Requests

WeWitness is built to preserve user-owned evidence while protecting user privacy.

## What We Store

- Encrypted video blobs (and minimal metadata needed for uploads/incidents)

## What We Can Provide

- Account and metadata records as required by valid legal process (implementation dependent)
- Encrypted blobs from storage when legally compelled

## What We Typically Cannot Provide (By Design)

- Decrypted video content if we do not possess the decryption keys by default

## User Notice

Where legally permitted, we aim to notify users of requests affecting their data.

## Transparency

We intend to publish a transparency summary (volume and type of requests) once operational.
