# Contributing to WeWitness

## Ground Rules

- No features that enable public location-based browsing of videos.
- Privacy-by-default is mandatory.
- Security issues: follow `SECURITY.md`.

## Development Setup

Setup docs will live under:
- `apps/mobile/README.md`
- `services/api/README.md`

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] No public feed or location stalking vectors introduced
- [ ] Minimal data collection; justified metadata only
- [ ] Tests added/updated (where applicable)
- [ ] Docs updated (`docs/`)

## Style

- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Prefer explicit naming and clear error handling in security-critical code.
